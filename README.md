# Huffman-encoder-and-decoder-
Project Description 1. Read the text file provided to you using MATLAB and compute the approximate probabilities of the different English characters (symbols) in this text file. The used characters are: lower case letters a-z, in addition to the following characters ( ) . , / -and the space character, i.e., 33 characters in total. 2. Calculate the entropy based on the symbol probabilities calculated in step one. 3. Calculate the number of bits/symbols required to construct a fixed length code and calculate the efficiency of that code. 4. Implement in MATLAB the Huffman encoder function and encode the file characters into a stream of zeros and ones. Show in a table each character in the source text file and its corresponding Huffman code. 5. Implement in MATLAB the Huffman decoder function and write the decoded stream of characters back to a separate text file, and make sure that it matches the original text file. 6. Calculate the efficiency of the Huffman code.
